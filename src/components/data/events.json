To realize the new opportunities that new technologies give us, we need to create a simple and understandable decentralized platform for trading derivative financial instruments (smart derivatives) that can be initiated by each market participant, create analytical methods for the basic assessment of financial contracts, ensure their implementation by introducing certain algorithms into the corresponding smart contracts, using the mechanism of collateral by different parties to the transaction. Another important tool for the implementation of such agreements is the inclusion, by mutual agreement of the parties, in smart derivatives of reliable information flows that provide another participant in the platform – the oracle.",
